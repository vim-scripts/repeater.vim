Repeater.vim allows you to repeat items {n} times. For example, if you have a
section header in ReStructuredText and you need to insert an underbar of
equals signs that's the same length, you can simply move down a line and
invoke ``:Repeater =``. You can also specify a length, but the real utility of
this plugin is calculating the length for you.

Examples
========

1. Insert 78 equals signs:
    :Repeater = 78
2. Insert a ReST or Markdown section header for the current line:
    :Repeater -
3. Insert "THIS IS FILLER" 999 times:
    :Repeater THIS\ IS\ FILLER.\  999
